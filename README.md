  Hi there! It seems you are looking at the raw Markdown code for this README
  file. To make things somewhat organized and convenient, I will do my best to
  maintain an 80-character limit per line whenever possible. It can be somewhat
  tricky given how long certain syntax must be, but the line limit will be
  adhered to when best to do so, a habit I got from using Google's C++ Code
  Style.

# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad
attending UC Davis. Feel free to roam around my repositories to see what
projects I have been working on lately. You could also take a look at my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alan-michel) or [GitHub
webpage](https://alamichel.github.io) for more information. (Bear in mind that
these pages, like the code in these repositories, are a work in progress,
undergoing development from time to time. I will do my best to make note of it in
the `README`, if available.)
